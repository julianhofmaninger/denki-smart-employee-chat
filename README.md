# denki-smart-employee-chat
## Mini Project 2 for LVA "Denkweisen der Informatik".
## Please Note: This project is just for educational purposes, applying such a chat system in real world businesses is very questionable from an ethical point of view.
This project's purpose is to demonstrate how easy it is to monitor employees' chatting activities using a very basic OpenAI API wrapper.
Basically, this application just sends the chat history of two employees to the OpenAI API, which is prompted to analyse how likely it is that two employees have an argument that goes beyond an objective discussion or that these two employees are chatting about sensitive data. If the probability of one of these two cases is high enough, a notification is sent to the HR department for further investigation.
